## Advantage of this website

1.Greater availability of medicines for people confined to their homes, or for those who live far from the pharmacy.

2.The online pharmacy website is a great way to manage pharmacy operations as it does not make bills for expired products.

3.This software alerts the staff at the counter about the expired medicines and helps the store owner to systematically purchase new items.

4.The pharmaceutical website helps owners send emails and SMS alerts to customers about lucrative offers and promotional schemes.

5.Easier access to written product information, and references to sources other than what you would typically find in traditional storefront pharmacies.
